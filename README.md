## Rebuild the documentation

### Official rebuilds

The documentation is rebuild on every release of lvgl (first and third Tuesday of every month).

### Build locally

The following directions are given for Ubuntu, but should also be useful as a general guide. They assume that https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl is cloned in a folder named `lvgl`, and https://github.com/lvgl/docs is beside it in another folder named `docs`. The paths are not important (both folders can be located anywhere) but you may have to adjust these instructions slightly.

To rebuild the API documentation, you need [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/).

```sh
$ ls .
docs lvgl
$ sudo apt install doxygen
$ cd lvgl/scripts
$ doxygen Doxyfile
```

The documentation is compiled into HTML or another form using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org). In order to get started Sphinx and some other components need to be installed on your system. 


Install dependencies:
```sh
$ pip install -U sphinx recommonmark commonmark breathe sphinx-rtd-theme sphinx-markdown-tables sphinx-sitemap
```

Get the `docs` and `lvgl` repositories
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/lvgl/docs.git --recurse-submodules 
$ git clone https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl.git
$ ls .
docs lvgl
```

Enter to the `docs` folder and change branch:
```sh
$ cd docs
$ git checkout latest --
$ git submodule update --init
```

Update the API reference of the `docs` from `lvgl` (optional):
```sh
$ rm xml/*
$ cd ../lvgl/scripts
$ doxygen -u
$ cd ../../docs
$ cp -a ../lvgl/docs/api_doc/xml/* xml/
```

Built HTML
```sh
$ make html
```

The HTML pages are in the `html`.
