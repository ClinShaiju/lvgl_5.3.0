# Arc (lv_arc)

## Overview

The Arc are consists of a background and a foreground arc. Both can have start and end angles and thickness.

## Parts and Styles
The Arc's main part is called `LV_ARC_PART_MAIN`. It draws a background using the typical background style properties and an arc using the *line* style properties.
The arc's size and position will respect the *padding* style properties.

`LV_ARC_PART_INDIC` is virtual part and it draws an other arc using the *line* style proeprties. It's padding values are interpreted relative to the background arc. 
The radius of the indicator arc will be modified according to the greatest padding value.

## Usage

### Angles

To set the angles of the background, use the `lv_arc_set_bg_angles(arc, start_angle, end_angle)` function or `lv_arc_set_bg_start/end_angle(arc, start_angle)`. 
Zero degree is at the middle right (3 o'clock) of the object and the degrees are increasing in a clockwise direction.
The angles should be in [0;360] range.

Similarly, `lv_arc_set_angles(arc, start_angle, end_angle)` function or `lv_arc_set_start/end_angle(arc, start_angle)` sets the angles of the indicator arc.
